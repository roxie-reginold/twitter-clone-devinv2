## Contributing to Documentation

When making changes to the codebase, please ensure that the documentation is updated to reflect those changes. The automated documentation workflow will help with this, but manual updates may still be necessary for complex changes.

If you're adding new features or making significant changes, consider adding new documentation files to this directory to explain the changes in detail.
